  <h1>Completed:</h1>
  <h2>R Programming and Tidyverse Specialization. Certificate 1. Week 1.</h2>
  <h3>Hands-On Programming with R - Chapter 2</h3>
  <h4>2.1-2.2</h4>
  <p class="functions-block">Functions:
  <ul>
  <li>ls()</li>
  <li>The colon operator (ðŸ˜ƒ returns every integer between two integers. It is an easy way to create a sequence of numbers.</li>
  <li>a &lt;- 1
  [1] 1</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but there are a few rules. First, a name cannot start with a number. Second, a name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or *:</p>
  <p>R is case sensitive</p>
  <p>R does not always follow the rules of matrix multiplication. Instead, R uses element-wise execution.</p>
  <p>R will apply the same operation to each element in the set. So for example, when you run die - 1, R subtracts one from each element of die.</p>
  <p>If you give R two vectors of unequal lengths, R will repeat the shorter vector until it is as long as the longer vector, and then do the math</p>
  <p>Element-wise operations will ensure that values from one observation or case are only paired with values from the same observation or case.
  [ This is where the elements in the same row are multiplied by one another. ]</p>
  <p>vector recycling
  If the length of the short vector does not divide evenly into the length of the long vector, R will return a warning message.</p>
  <p>But donâ€™t think that R has given up on traditional matrix multiplication. You just have to ask for it when you want it. You can do inner multiplication with the %*% operator and outer multiplication with the %o% operator.</p>
  <h4>2.3</h4>
  <p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
  Functions:
  sample takes two arguments: a vector named x and a number named size. sample will return size elements from the vector.</p>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>sample(x = 1:4, size = 2)
  ## 3 2
  </code></pre>
  <p>If youâ€™re not sure which names to use with a function, you can look up the functionâ€™s arguments with args. To do this, place the name of the function in the parentheses behind args.</p>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>args(round)
  ## function (x, digits = 0) 
  ## NULL
  </code></pre>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  ## 5 5
  ## the argument replace = TRUE causes sample to sample with replacement. . Each value has a chance of being selected each time. A sample of size one that is independent of the other values.
  </code></pre>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>dice &lt;- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  dice
  ## 2 4

  sum(dice)
  ## 6
  </code></pre>
  <p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p>
  <p>The data that you pass into the function is called the functionâ€™s argument.</p>
  <p>When you link functions together, R will resolve them from the innermost operation to the outermost.</p>
  <p>You can give a function as many arguments as you like as long as you separate each argument with a comma.</p>
  <p>You can pass a new value to an optional argument if you want, and R will use the default value if you do not.</p>
  <h4>2.4.1</h4>
  <p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
  Functions:</p>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>my_function &lt;- function() {
    die &lt;- 1:6
    dice &lt;- sample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
    sum(dice)
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>R ignores spaces and line breaks and executes one complete expression at a time.</p>
  <p>Giving the bones argument a default value. To do this, set bones equal to a value when you define roll2:</p>
  <pre class="hljs"><code>roll2 &lt;- function(bones = 1:6) {
    dice &lt;- sample(bones, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
    sum(dice)
  }
  </code></pre>
  <dl>
  <dt>Now you can supply a new value for bones if you like, and roll2 will use the default if you do not.</dt>
  </dl>
  <h4>2.6 Scripts</h4>
  <p>R will run whichever line of code your cursor is on. If you have a whole section highlighted, R will run the highlighted code. Alternatively, you can run the entire script by clicking the Source button. Donâ€™t like clicking buttons? You can use Control + Return as a shortcut for the Run button. On Macs, that would be Command + Return.</p>
  <p>Scripts are multi-line code (console has single-line command line).</p>
  <p>CREATING A FUNCTION FROM THE SCRIPT
  RStudio comes with a tool that can help you build functions. To use it, highlight the lines of code in your R script that you want to turn into a function. Then click Code &gt; Extract Function in the menu bar. RStudio will ask you for a function name to use and then wrap your code in a function call. It will scan the code for undefined variables and use these as arguments.</p>
